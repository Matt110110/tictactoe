# TicTacToe

A tic-tac-toe game using command prompt.

## Constraints:
* There are two players playing on a 3X3 grid
* Each player gets to choose their own symbols (X/O)
* The first player to get three of their symbols horizontally, vertically or diagonally wins
* At the end of the game there should be a prompt to repeat the game or exit

## Change log
1. The visuals of the game are complete.
2. Players can be defined and select their box position.
3. Selected position gets updated with the player symbol.
4. In case player selects an already filled box he instantly loses.
5. Dual printing bug fixed completely and looping bug partially fixed.

## TODO:
* Define the actual logic of the program, to test whether the game is over or not and check if someone won or it's a stalemate.
* Remove the dual printing bug for player two.
